            <h1>Colorado Destination Point</h1>

        </header>

        <p>
            Colorado, a western U.S. state, has a diverse landscape of arid desert, river canyons and snow-covered Rocky Mountains, which
            are partly protected by Rocky Mountain National Park. Elsewhere, Mesa Verde National Park features Ancestral
            Puebloan cliff dwellings. Perched a mile above sea level, Denver, Colorado’s capital and largest city, features
            a vibrant downtown area.
        </p>


        <h2>WELCOME TO THE MILE HIGH CITY</h2>

        <p>
            Welcome to Denver, where 300 days of sunshine, a thriving cultural scene, diverse neighborhoods, and natural beauty combine
            for the world's most spectacular playground.

        <h3>Things Not to Miss in Colorado</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hitting the slopes in total luxury at an Aspen ski resort, or at Vail Mountain</li>
            <li>Taking in a concert at the scenic Red Rocks Amphitheatre, set between 400-foot-high red sandstone rocks</li>


            <li> Taking a tour (and swigging a beer) at the New Belgium Brewery</li>


            <li> Hopping on a vintage steam locomotive at the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad</li>


            <li>Getting pampered in the mineral-rich San Juan River pools at the Springs Resort & Spa</li>


            <li> Climbing Pikes Peak, or hiking the Royal Arch Trail</li>

        </ul>
        <h3> When to Go to Colorado</h3>
        <p>
            Winter is often the season of choice for making Colorado travel plans; during ski season, prices will be at a premium, but
            skiers and snowboarders will enjoy fresh power during the day and a thriving nightlife scene to enjoy off the
            slopes. Winter in Colorado means cold weather, so bundle up accordingly and prepare for the occasional snowstorm.
            However, Colorado is still a great travel destination during seasons, and tourists who visit Colorado outside
            of ski season will be rewarded with lower hotel and flight rates; summers in Colorado are warm and dry, while
            the weather is cooler in the fall, and you can watch the leaves change.

                    <p>Just a few miles from the town of Estes Park, Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the most popular
                        national parks in the United States. The soaring mountain peaks, alpine lakes and meadows, forests,
                        and abundant wildlife showcase nature at its best. The park has more than 100 peaks over 10,000 feet,
                        including Longs Peak, the highest in the park, at 14,259 feet.</p>

                    <p>Mesa Verde was home to the Ancestral Pueblo who inhabited the dwellings from approximately 600 AD to
                        1300 AD. Thousands of archeological sites lie within the park, although the cliff dwellings are the
                        most spectacular. A road allows access to numerous sites, many of which are on top of the mesa. A
                        number of hiking trails, which do not require a ranger tour, lead to lookouts and interesting sites,
                        including petroglyphs.

                    <p>Garden of the Gods, a registered National Natural Landmark, is a unique landscape of jagged stone towers
                        and fins jutting up 300 feet from the earth, and giant balanced boulders and rock piles dotting the
                        landscape, with distant mountains completing the scene. s Fifteen miles of trails, most of which
                        are short and easy, allow you to get up close to the dramatic rock formations and wander through
                        the surreal scenery. The park is a popular area for rock climbing, but other activities in the park
                        include road biking in designated biking lanes, mountain biking, horseback riding, and Jeep and Segway
                        tours.

                    <p>Vail doesn't always fit with everyone's budget, particularly if you want to spend a night during the
                        high season. In the vicinity are a number of small towns and villages that are less well known but
                        more affordable and also worth a visit. Frisco is a charming mountain town, but not a ski resort.
                        This is a nice base if you are exploring the I-70 Corridor around Vail and Beaver Creek. The town
                        has all kinds of quirky cafés, shops, and restaurants, and a true mountain vibe. Just up the way
                        from here is the small town and ski resort of Breckenridge, at an altitude of 9,600 feet.</p>

                    <p>At 14,115 feet in elevation, Pikes Peak, in Pike National Forest, is one of the Southwest's famous "fourteeners,"
                        a reference to mountains that stand over 14,000 feet. The snow-capped peak is easily recognizable
                        from the nearby town of Colorado Springs. This is one of the most visited mountains in the world,
                        second only to Mt. Fuji. Unlike many mountain peaks that are inaccessible to the average person,
                        you can drive to the summit of Pikes Peak on the Pikes Peak Highway, off highway 24, west of Colorado
                        Springs. Travel time is about 1.5 hours. Alternatively, you can take the Pikes Peak Cog Railway for
                        a scenic 8.9-mile trip, with a round-trip time of just over three hours.</p>
